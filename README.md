# Typed ToDo App

This project is a part of the Frontend internship program at [Foothill Technology Solutions](https://github.com/FoothillSolutions). The goal of this task is to create a React application using TypeScript, implementing interfaces for typing any passed props.
## Overview

## Features

- **State Management**: Efficient state handling for adding, marking, and deleting to-do items.
- **Display To-Do Items**: Render to-do items dynamically using the `map` method.
- **Add To-Do Items**: Input field and button to add new to-do items.
- **Mark as Completed**: Checkbox to mark to-do items as completed.
- **Delete To-Do Items**: Ability to delete to-do items from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **React + TypeScript**: Core libraries for building the application.
- **MUI**: Material-UI for designing user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster and leaner development.
